# Java-IRC
The Web Chat Interface project allows two or more clients to communicate through a proprietary communication protocol developed in Java. This project has been designed to control all aspects of the system, including the client, server, storage, and communication protocol. Anyone can host the server, from anywhere.

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
To install and run the client or server, simply clone the repository, import into your IDE of choice, compile and run either `WebChatClientGUI.java` or `WebChatServerGUI.java`. Ensure you have forwarded the inbound server port on your router, default `5100`, and created an inbound rule through your firewall.
